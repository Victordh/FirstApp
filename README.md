Random number guessing game - This app picks a random number between 0 and
1000 and asks the user to guess which number it is. Gives hints when
guessed incorrectly: whether the user should try guessing higher or lower.
Keeps track of the amount of guesses and the range in which the user should
be guessing. The game can be reset with the click of a button.
